Lab #8 Report

	From the user perspective, this program animates a carnival ride with four different axes of motion all chained together. The animation is meant to run until the user presses q to quit. The first axes of motion is linear movement of blue lines along the horizontal red line. The second is the circular motion of the blue lines. The third is is the circular motion of "half" of the cars on the plane of the screen. The fourth is the the circular motion of the remaining cars, into and out of the screen. Essentially, the axes of motion alternates between cars. This is displayed clearly with change of color. This program uses an extension of the drawn "base" of animate.c(ferris wheel) of Lab7.
	The program structured internally with a short main file that calls different functions such as: getCoordinates, drawBlueLines, drawSpinningCars, and drawpolygon. The getCoordinates function takes the coordinates center of rotation(a point) and calculates coordinates of other points. These points will be used to continually redraw the blue lines that rotate along the red line(taken care of by the drawBlueLines function. The center of rotation also does not leave the red line, by use of the method in bounce.c. The function drawSpinningCars is a special because it involves two axes of motion, alternating them between cars. The drawpolygon function is the same as the one used in lab7.
	I verified that the output of the program was correct by running the program with different values for variables initialized at the beginning of the main function. The animation output was as expected.
