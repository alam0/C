Lab #6 Report

	From the user's perspective, this program stores and manages a text file consisting of their favorite sayings. Immediately after the program is run, the user is prompted to enter the name of an existing text file of his/her choosing. Then the user is presented with options and asked to decide how they would manage their sayings. Option 1 displays all sayings currently in the database, and option 2 allows the user to enter a new saying into the database. If the user decides on option 2, he/she is prompted to type in the new saying. Option 3 allows the user to type in a word that the program will list all sayings containing that word, and option 4 allows the user to save the current sayings in a new text file with a user-specified name. The program will continue to ask the user what he/she would like to do with the sayings and perform the commands until the quit option of 0 is entered.
	The program is structured with functions and a main file. First the program prompts the user for the name of their text file, opens it and reads it into a 2x2 array using printf,scanf, pointers and the useful function fgets. Then the program consists of a while loop that prints questions and runs a through commands of a case structure while the user's choice is not equal to 0. The case structure utilizes the functions addSaying and wordSearch that are listed in prototypes above main and defined in definitions under main. These functions take in the 2x2 array and integer values and make changes to the array by reference. 
	I evaluated the program for correctness by testing through each of the options multiple times with different inputs and outputs. I also ran the program for the new text files created in the new text file option(4). I also spent a fair amount of time checking through the program and made sure it was clear to understand. This program was enjoyable to work through. Thank you.
