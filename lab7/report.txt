Lab #7 Report

	From the user perspective, this program is a spinning ferris wheel that speeds up, slows down, and has cars that change shapes to different polygons. The ferris begins spinning at a constant speed and speeds up when the up arrow is pressed down and slows down when the down arrow is pressed. Pressing any of the numbers from 3 to 9 will change the cars of the wheel to a polygon of that many sides. The animation continues until the user presses the q key to quit the animation and close the window.
	The program is structured with a drawpolygon function (prototype before main, definition after main) and then main file that initializes all the variables and contains the main while loop. The drawpolygon function is the same as the one I wrote for symbol.c. I had the idea that it could be used in the main file's while loop that continously redraws the ferris wheel. The while loop consists of the incremention, change of color, drawing, gfx_clear(), gfx_flush(), usleep(), gfx_event_waiting(), and gfx_wait(). I created 2 arrays for the x and y values that were repeated calculated in a "for" loop inside the main while loop. The 6 cars would remain equidistant from one another while the ferris wheel spun so the change in angle for each car would be the same and then change for each successive iteration. I used gfx_line and gfx_circle to create the ferris wheel and base and drawpolygon to create the cars. To make the animation interactive, I used gfx_event_waiting() and gfx_wait() and a switch/case statement to change shape and speed of the cars. 
	I verified the output of the code for animate.c by testing it many times with minor changes to variables and checking if the mentioned key presses produced desired results.
